# IOT_Firebase_python_listener
Listen to changes to a firebase document. Useful for updating settings on an IOT device.

The script.py requires a settings.json in the same directory as the script. It also requires you to setup a service account for your project. The process to create the service account (and download the json) can be found here: https://firebase.google.com/support/guides/service-accounts
