# IOT_Firebase_python_listener
Listen to changes to a firebase document. Useful for updating settings on an IOT device.

The script.py requires a settings.json in the same directory as the script. I will be updating the script to create the file if it is no there. It also requires you to setup a service account for your project. The process to create the service account (and download the credentials json) can be found here https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys
